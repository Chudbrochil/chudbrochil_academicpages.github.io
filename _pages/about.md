Anthony Galczak is a results-driven machine learning engineer and applied scientist with deep expertise in causal inference, large-scale experimentation, and modern AI systems. A Stanford-trained computer scientist, Anthony brings a strong blend of scientific rigor and engineering execution to every project.

At Microsoft, he serves as the architect of the **Experiment Insights Framework**, a platform supporting causal, Bayesian, and frequentist evaluation across 10+ product teams. His work has driven over **$100M in impact**, including **$40M in annualized LTV** from Azure pricing and offer experiments. He has led product measurement for key initiatives such as **Azure Copilot** and multiple **Copilot for Service** deployments, shaping how Microsoft's AI tools are evaluated and scaled. Anthony regularly presents on **LLMs**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **evaluation methodologies**.

In 2025, Anthony led the redesign and deployment of the **Cases At Risk** model, built to identify support tickets most at risk of low CSAT scores. The model was integrated into Microsoft’s DFM Copilot workflows and has driven over **$20M in annualized cost savings** by proactively surfacing at-risk cases for intervention.

Earlier roles at Amazon, Akuna Capital, and Sandia National Labs saw Anthony delivering novel ML solutions across classification, anomaly detection, and scalable infrastructure. He has contributed to open-source projects such as **AutoGluon** and holds multiple first-author contributions within internal applied science publications.

Anthony holds an **M.S. in Computer Science** from Stanford University, where he was a teaching assistant and researcher in the Stanford AI Lab. He also holds dual **B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics** from the University of New Mexico.

He is currently exploring new opportunities as an Applied Scientist, Research Engineer, or Machine Learning Engineer with teams focused on ambitious AI challenges.

## Beyond Work

Outside of work, Anthony enjoys scuba diving, strength training, and traveling to explore new cultures and cuisines. He’s a dedicated learner who spends downtime exploring foundational ML papers and new reasoning models. He’s always on the lookout for good espresso and a better home office setup. Anthony lives with his fiancée and their two dogs.
