excerpt: 'Abstract: We present a stereo-camera-based 3D vehicle-tracking system that utilizes Kalman filtering to improve
robustness. The objective of our system is to accurately predict locations and orientations of vehicles from
stereo camera data. It consists of three modules: a 2D object detection network, 3D position extraction, and
3D object correlation/smoothing. The system approaches the 3D localization performance of LIDAR and
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art monocular vehicle tracking systems. The addition of Kalman
filtering increases our systemâ€™s robustness to missed detections, and improves the recall of our detector. Kalman
filtering improves the MAP score of 3D localization for moderately difficult vehicles by 7.7%, compared to
our unfiltered baseline. Our system predicts the correct orientation of vehicles with 78% accuracy.
