excerpt: 'Abstract: Child Speech Recognition (CSR) is a less explored and more challenging task than typical Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
This task has significant applications in the
classroom and is especially important in a
remote learning environment. We present
findings from training deep-learning based
speech recognition models on the MyST corpus, the largest publicly-available English language child speech corpus. We obtained
27.26% word error rate (WER) on the MyST
test set with a DeepSpeech2 baseline. Our best
model, a Conformer model pre-trained on LibriSpeech and fine-tuned using the MyST corpus, achieved a test WER of 23.45%. Our
results show that pre-training on adult speech
is essential for model performance. We also
provide additional error analysis on our best
model and discussion of the results.'
